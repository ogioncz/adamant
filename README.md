adamant
=======

Project adamant aims to map every possible piece of data about Club Penguin.

There will actually be two components – semantic database and engine queryable by some kind of query language.

Data will be collected both automatically and manually.

Here is an example of queries that the engine would be able to answer:
* What non-member items can golden puffle dig?
* Which newspaper issues featured Cadence?
* What games could you play on Jul 21, 2009?

This project isn’t achievable by a person alone so building a community will be required.
